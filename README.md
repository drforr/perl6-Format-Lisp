# Format::Lisp [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/drforr/perl6-Format-Lisp.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/drforr/perl6-Format-Lisp)
Format::Lisp
============

Implementing Common Lisp's (format) language for Perl 6 - Mostly because it's
an interesting challenge, but partially because it offers much more powerful
options than any sprintf-style formatter, including Python and Ruby's.

Installation
============

* Using zef (a module management tool bundled with Rakudo Star):

```
    zef update && zef install Format::Lisp
```

## Testing

To run tests:

```
    prove -e perl6
```
